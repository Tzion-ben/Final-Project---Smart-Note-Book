#  Smart house management project
## Overview
The IoT smart house management project is a visionary initiative dedicated to enhancing the quality of everyday life within the home environment through the deployment of advanced sensor technologies. This innovative system seeks to create a harmonious and convenient living space by embedding an array of sensors throughout the house. These sensors are designed to intelligently monitor various aspects of the home, from temperature and humidity to occupancy and energy consumption. By collecting and analyzing real-time data, the project aims to optimize the home environment, ensuring that it's always comfortable, efficient, and secure. Whether it's adjusting heating and cooling systems based on occupancy patterns, or automatically adjusting lighting to match natural daylight, this project represents a paradigm shift towards a more intuitive, responsive, and environmentally conscious way of living.


## Our Main Feature
* Turning on and off electricity. Including AC, light, and everything that needs electricity based on data from other sensors.
* For example, turning on the AC in a room when a temperature sensor detects certain temperature

## Architecture 

* Ui designed as an Android application
* We use MVC architecture for this project
* We used MongoDB as our Database for storing data
 

## Hardware
* Controller - esp 8266 Node MCU
* Relay 1 channel 5v
* Dht11 temperature sensor

### We use regular a lamp for the example, the lamp can replaced by other electric switching devices:
